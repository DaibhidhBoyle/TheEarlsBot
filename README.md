# TheEarlsBot

Basic Commands
A set of commands to get new viewers familiar with the basics of your brand; from you’re name to why you talk about soap. These commands come in handy with lots of people entering the chat that aren’t frequent viewers (like in raids or if your gaining traction on a twitch category), answering their FAQs as a group and starting conversations.
 
Start-up Messsage:- Hello everyone. The Suds Bot is here and ready help with whatever you need

Command: - !welcome

Reply:- Welcome to the Earl of Suds twitch channel. The Earl is Kenny White, a Texan gamer dedicated to great gameplay, engaging with his community and being a wholesome bean. Please make yourself at home and get friendly in chat.

Command: - !royalitysoap/!rs

Reply: - Kenny works alongside his family to make luxury, hand-crafted soaps and invites you be part of the process through high quality crafting videos. Find out more at https://www.royaltysoaps.com/ or get a look at those 'making of' videos at youtube.com/royaltysoaps

Command: - !when/!schedule

Reply:- Catch the stream 8pm CST on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays!

Limitations: - Although these commands can help people get their heads around a new streamer and their background some viewers might feel they’re not getting to interact with you naturally in chat to discover these things. The amount of interaction you usually have with your chat would stop this and make sure they still feel welcome. 
These commands are not dynamic. If anything changes, like your schedule, they would have to be altered on a programming level.

Social Commands


Commands to direct people to your other social media platforms, keeping them engaging cross platform. These commands are particularly useful to mobile users that can’t see your widgets and rely on chat. Having the links directly rather than having to search them out will make them more likely to follow your projects across other site in turn keeping you in their thoughts, bring them back to the twitch stream. As an added benefit most have are phrased in a couple of different ways so regular watchers won’t get bored of seeing the same message repeatedly.

Limitations:- Similar to the last bunch of commands, these are all static and if they need to be altered it would have to be done at the programming level. 
Some replies are wordy and may leave viewer lost on the information they were looking for. This is counteracted by the links being highlighted on the twitch chat but if needed the copy can be stripped back to essentials
Earl of Suds and Royalty Soap links are mingled into a single reply. The copy should make it clear which is which and by presenting both viewer are more likely to follow both pages simultaneously. However if viewers get confused by this these commands will serve both brands better by being split into separate commands.

Shout Out Command

This command can produce links to other twitch streamer.  Useful in building a community of streamers that support each other, sharing audience through co-promotion and encourages raids. This command is superior to pre-packaged ones as it allows for multiple shout outs in one commands pulling from various adducting sentences so the reply doesn’t feel stale. It can shout out unlimited channels in one command until twitch universal chat length cap is hit. This command is limited to mods to stop spamming self-promotions from bad actors.

Command:- !shoutout @{streamer}/!so @{streamer}

Example Reply:- Don't let your fun on twitch end with The Earl! There are other great channels; give dai101 some love at www.twitch.tv/dai101.

Command:- !shoutout @{ streamer1} @{streamer2} @{streamer3}/!so @{ streamer1} @{streamer2} @{streamer3}

Example Reply:- Don't let your fun on twitch end with The Earl! There are other great channels; catch dai101's stream on www.twitch.tv/dai101 Or take a look at theearlofsuds over on www.twitch.tv/theearlofsuds Or try lime_meringue out over at www.twitch.tv/lime_meringue

Error catch:- !shoutout/!so

Reply:- Looks like your trying to shout someone out but you haven't said who. If you want to shout someone out be sure to @ them
 
Error catch:- !shoutout words with no at/!so words with no at

Reply:- Looks like your trying to shout someone out but you haven't said who. If you want to shout someone out be sure to @ them

Limitations:- This command is designed to be used alongside with twitch’s tagging function. As such and in the interest of speedy replies the created link is not validated, if an error is made in spelling in streamers name or the streamer does not exist on twitch that created link will be defunct and lead to a twitch error page.
This command can only be used to create twitch links. If there is an interest in linking to other platform another command would need to be made or this would have to be done manually.


Streak Command
A command designed to inform viewer the number of successive days you’ve streamed. I notice for a while you were streaming daily, this command bring the community into that process by giving replies costumed to how many days you’ve streamed in a row. This will bring viewer coming back with an easy way to track how long you’re streak has been going and allows for them to keep up with streak goals you may set(like play fornite on the 14th day in a row of streaming). 

Command:- !streak

Reply:-
(For a streak of 1 day) - Kenny is just starting a new streak! This is day 1

(For a streak between 2 to 3 days) - We're just getting started. Current streak is (number) days!

(For a streak between 4 to 6 days)- Things are heating up! Kennys streak is (number) days in a row

(For a streak of 7 days) - Wow! The Earls has streamed every day for a week straight!

(For a streak between 8 to 13 days) Kenny current streaming streak is a blazing (number) days in a row!

(For a streak of 14 days)- Good Golly! Kenny has streamed every day for a fortnight!

(For a streak between 15 to 24 days)- The Earl's on a hot streak; he's streamed for a mighty (number) days in a row!

(For a streak of above 25 days)- Hot Dang! The Earl of Suds has streamed every day for (number) days! Now that's impressive.

Error catch:- There's been a small problem tracking this streak. Please message da101 here on twitch and he'll get that sorted asap. Sorry for the inconvenience

Limitations:- The program tracks days by when it is started up not by when you’re stream is active. The prevents confusion in the program over if you stream on the same day or if you have to restart a stream but would mean you’d have to start the program on each stream and cannot leave it running till the next stream otherwise it would not be recorded on the streak. This also leaves an weakness where if you start the program without streaming you could get inaccurate reading on this command; maintaining a streak that should be lost.

Soap Command
This command takes in a search term from the viewer and finds matching products from the royalty soaps website. This will give easier access for viewer to buy products from royalty soap and start conversations in chat. It is searched for dynamically so any new product on the website can be searched by this command automatically 

Command:- !soap {search term}

Reply:- 
(for one matching product)- I found the (product) available at (link)

(for multiple matching products)- There's a lot of great products matching your search! Like the (product) Available at (link). Have a look at them all at (full search results)

(for no matching products)- I couldn't find anything matching your search results. :( but you can checkout out Royalty Soap's whole range at www.royaltysoaps.com

Error Catch:- That could be a lot of great products! Check them all out here (full search results)

Limitations:- This command goes directly to the royalty soaps website to complete the search, this can take up to a few seconds. During this time other commands may also have delayed replies or replies may be lost entirely.
The error catch for the command has a link related to the search. If the program acts very unexpectedly this link may be defunct.

Bot Maintenance Commands 
These commands give the program a bit of personality in chat, get some information about its functionality and allows for viewer who encounter bugs to report them reducing frustration. This will make the program feel more natural to have in chat and help viewers adopt its use.

Command:- !sudsbot

Reply:- I am The Suds Bot; a chatbot here to help with whatever you need. Nice to meet you! I have a bunch of neat commands, Try using !soap and description of a soap you like to help find new one you might like or !streak to find out how many days in a row the Earl has been on twitch.

Command:- @ThesudsBot

Reply:- Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your time visiting the channel more pleasant
OR

OR

Command:- Good Bot

Reply:- That warms the cogs of my little bot heart :) thank you for your feed back
OR

Command:- Bad Bot

Reply:- Sorry, I'm a young bot and still make mistakes. :( If you find any issues with my functionality please whisper dai101 here on twitch and he'll try to get that patched up

Limitations:- Bug reports are only suggested to be sent to my twitch, without alternative. If my twitch channel is no longer viable there is no way to report bugs. 
The words Good Bot or Bad Bot will trigger these commands whether they are about this bot or another on the channel.
There is no list of commands from this program other than those presented in the !sudsbot command. This not to put too much information into chat at once and there is no website with this information to link out to like most bots. This could leave viewer unsure of The Suds Bot’s full functionality.
